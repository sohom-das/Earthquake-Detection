# Earthquake-Detection
This is a machine learning algorithm to predict earthquakes.  It uses both supervised and unsupervised learning. In Supervised Learning, it compares the accuracies of four different models (i.e., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree). In Unsupervised I have used K-means Clustering to predict the earthquakes.
